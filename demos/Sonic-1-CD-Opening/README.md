# Sonic 1 CD Opening
This mod makes it so that Sonic CD's opening plays after the title screen.

## How to install
Assuming you have alrady extracted your Sonic 1 Data.rsdk and downloaded the latest Sonic 1 script decompilation:
* Copy the "Scripts" folder in this folder on top of the "Scripts" folder in the folder where you downloaded the RSDKv4-V files.
* Copy the "videos" folder from the Steam version of Sonic CD into the folder where you downloaded the RSDKv4-V files.
* Open RSDKv4-V, select "No Save" (or choose a new save), and press a button at the title screen. Sonic CD's opening will now play.
